## About the project

This is my <strong>7<sup>th</sup></strong> Frontend Mentor challenge.

This is my solution to the REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of this challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## Built with

For this project i used:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- REST Countries V2 API
- Font Awesome

## What you can do?!

I need your opinions, feedbacks , how do you find my code structure? or any suggestions i can do to make my projects better. Also if you guys like my content, follow me this makes me happy‚ù§üëç.

## Useful resources

- **Adobe Xd** - I use adobe xd to check the size of elements.

## Acknowledgments

- I don't have sketch or figma files. So the final result isn't pixel perfect.
- I want to say **Thanks** to anyone who see my work and react with it, give me his feedback and helped me to improve myself. So thank you‚ù§.



**See you in another project!** üëãüë©‚Äçüíª
